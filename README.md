# Heart-Stroke-Analysis
I am using the heart stroke data-set for this homework assignment 5 which I downloaded from the Kaggle data portal. This data is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, heart conditions like hyper-tension, heart disease, glucose level in blood and smoking status.
